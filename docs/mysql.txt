# MySql server configuration

## IP and port configuration.

We store global clients information in mysql database.
MySql server is running in elephant-dev.colorcloud.com at ip 69.25.109.230

We need to open up port 3306 for mysql in iptable.
    $IPTABLES -A $CHAIN -j ACCEPT -p tcp --dport 3306

To verify reachability,
    telnet elephant-dev.colorcloud.com 3306


## my.conf

disable skip-networking.
set bind-address in to be your host ip rather than localhost.
  bind-address=YOUR-SERVER-IP

then restart mysql with 
    service mysql stop start


## Grant permissions.

For application to connect to mysql server, we need to grant the permission.

To grant access to a new database
    mysql> GRANT ALL ON spdyclient.* TO root@'%' IDENTIFIED BY 'elephant';

To grant access to existing database.

    mysql> GRANT ALL ON spdyclient.* TO root@'%' IDENTIFIED BY 'elephant';
or
    mysql> GRANT ALL ON spdyclient.* TO nobody@'%' IDENTIFIED BY 'elephant';
