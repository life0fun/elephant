# SpdyLay

We use spdylay library as our test client.
Spdylay is an open source implementation of spdy based on c.

Please read the README file for configurations.


We create a client folder that contains our simulated client code.

## Generate statically linked client

Spdylay uses libtool to generate shared library and example programs are 
bash executables that dynamically link to spdylay lib at runtime.

Because executable bash script has link path hard-coded, we need to generate
statically linked binary so we can distribute it to various machines to test.

To generate both shared and static library, change configure.ac file,
    LT_INIT([shared static])

The generated static linked binary is located at 
   $CLIENT/.libs/spdycli


## Distribution

We need to distribut both spdycli and libspdylay.so.1 and supply LD_LIBRARY_PATH=.


## run 10k clients
    export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=. ./spdycli -p -n 10000
